# Phasor-Complex-Calculator
A simple calculator to convert and operate on Phasor and Complex values for Electrical Engineering. At this point, I am a freshman at Duke University trying to mess around and figure things out in Github and VScode. 

This is done in VScode using ipynb (Jupyter Notebook with python anaconda kernal 3.12.7)

This should contain: 
a working converter of Phasor to complex and complex to Phasor. 
Calculator that considers both phasor and complex inputs and is able to perform basics operations (add, sub, mul, div) on those values and return the value in phasor or complex depending on the inputs.
